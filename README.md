# N-body-collision
## Author: Jeremiah Hanson

This is a project that will have two parts. A sequential program and a parallel program to calculate 2d body collisions

## Run

This program takes four arguments as follows:
	1: number of threads (sequential ignores this, but it is still required)
	2: number of bodies
	3: size of the bodies
	4: number of time steps
